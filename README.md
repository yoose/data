Fandango Movie Ratings: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/yoose/data/master?filepath=Project_Fandango_Ratings.ipynb)

This project investigates the accuracy of Fandango's movie ratings and is motivated by the work done by Walt Hickey, a journalist, who discovered in 2015 that Fandango's ratings were suspicious. The goal of this project is to determine if Fandango fixed the bug they claimed was responsible for the inaccurate ratings.
